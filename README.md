A very basic DJ-like set up using OSC and Pure Data.

There are options for playing midi instruments and basic beat with kick, snare and hi hats.
- The grid buttons play midi notes
- The toggle buttons 1-7 select between the 128 midi instruments
- The 8th toggles the beat pattern on and off
- 9 - 12: kick
- 13 - 16: snare
- 17 - 20: hi hats
- 21 - 24: adjust beats per minute (treat it as a binary number, each digit representing 10 bpm with 60 bpm as a base)

The sliders are used for the volume of the left, right, and master audio and the duration of the midi notes.
The front buttons can play kicks, snares and drums
The 2D button plays a sine wave, changing its pitch (x) and volume (y)
